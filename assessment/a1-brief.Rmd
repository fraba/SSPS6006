## Overview

For this assignment, you are required to write a research proposal for your final research project. This proposal will help you get timely feedback on your final project. The proposal must be 700 words in length (±10%) and will focus on a research design that involves quantitative methods and data analysis addressing a social science research topic. You are not expected to collect the data yourself. Instead you should rely on available secondary data. 

## Structure of the Research Proposal

Your research proposal should include the following sections:

### 1. Introduction

In this section, provide a brief introduction to your research topic. Explain the context and significance of the topic you have chosen. Discuss any relevant background information that will help to frame your study and clarify the broader context in which your research is situated.

### 2. Purpose Statement

The purpose statement should clearly articulate the intent of your research. It should specify what you aim to achieve through your research. The purpose statement is crucial as it defines the central aim of the study. According to Creswell and Creswell (2022), a well-crafted purpose statement establishes the intent of the research in a clear, specific, and informative manner. The purpose statement should include information about:

- **Variables**: Identify the key variables in the study, including independent, dependent, mediating, and moderating variables, and describe their relationships. Use terms like "relationship," "comparison," "correlation," or "prediction."
- **Participants**: Mention the participants (or the unit of analysis) involved in the study.
- **Theoretical Framework**: Reference the theory or model that explains or predicts the relationships among the variables.

### 3. Hypothesis and Research Questions

Next, outline your hypothesis and research questions. Your hypothesis will be a testable prediction about the relationships between variables. Additionally, formulate research questions that will guide your data analysis and help to narrow the focus of your study.

### 4. Methods

The methods section should detail the procedures you will use to conduct your research. This includes:

- **Data Collection**: Describe the secondary data sources you will use. Explain why these data sources are appropriate for your study and how you will access them.
- **Data Analysis**: Briefly outline the statistical methods and tools you plan to use to analyse the data. 

### 5. Reference

- Include all references cited in your report using APA style.

## Submission Requirements

- Submit your proposal as a PDF (.pdf) or a Word document (.docx).
- The report should be 700-word long (±10%).
