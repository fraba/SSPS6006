## Assignment Description

This assignment aims to provide students with practical experience in conducting data analysis using R. You will be required to apply various data analysis techniques to collect, clean, manipulate, describe, and analyse a dataset relevant to social science research. This exercise is designed to enhance your skills in handling real-world data and interpreting results within the context of social science theories and frameworks.

## Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will have demonstrated to be able to:

1. **Collect Data**: Identify and gather data from relevant sources.
2. **Clean Data**: Perform data cleaning to ensure the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis.
3. **Manipulate Data**: Apply data manipulation techniques to prepare the dataset for analysis.
4. **Describe Data**: Use descriptive statistics and visualisations to summarise the dataset.
5. **Analyse Data**: Conduct appropriate statistical analyses to address a (simple) research question and hypothesis.
6. **Report Results**: Present your findings in a clear and structured manner, using R Markdown to integrate code and output.

## Assignment Instructions

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Choose a dataset relevant to a social science topic of interest. This could be from publicly available sources such as government databases, online repositories, or research publications.
   - Ensure the dataset has enough variables and observations to perform meaningful analyses.
   - In this exercise you should not use the same data you plan to use in your final research project.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Import the dataset into R.
   - Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Ensure all variables are correctly formatted.

3. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Transform variables as needed (e.g., creating new variables, recoding existing ones).
   - Merge or subset the data if necessary to focus on specific aspects of your research question.

4. **Data Description**:
   - Provide descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for key variables.
   - Create visualisations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to illustrate data distributions and relationships.

5. **Data Analysis**:
   - Choose appropriate statistical methods to analyse the data (e.g., regression analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests).
   - Interpret the results within the context of your research question and social science theory.

6. **Reporting Results**:
   - Use R Markdown to compile your report. The report should include three sections for Methods, Results and Discussion.
   - Include tables and figures generated by your R code to support your findings.

## Report Structure

1. **Methods**:
   - Describe the dataset (use words, tables and/or figures) and the data collection process.
   - Outline the steps taken for data cleaning and manipulation.
   - Explain the statistical methods used for analysis.

2. **Results**:
   - Present the results of your descriptive and inferential analyses.
   - Use tables and figures to summarise key findings.

3. **Discussion**:
   - Interpret the results in the context of a (simple) research question.

## Submission Requirements

- Submit your report as a PDF rendered from a .Rmd file.
- Embed R code within the report to demonstrate how analyses were performed.
- Include comments within your R code to explain each step of your analysis.
- Compress and submit your project folder (.zip file). The folder should contain the source .Rmd file, the .Rproj file and the dataset you used for the analysis.
- The report should be 550-word long (Â±10%). To estimate the length of your report use the RStudio function "Edit -> Word count" on your source .Rmd file. 
- Ensure the report is well-organised.
- Your report should include at least one data visualisation.
